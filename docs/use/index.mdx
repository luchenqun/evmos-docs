## 什么是Evmos？

Evmos是一个区块链网络，让您可以使用全球开发者构建的新一代应用程序。使用和构建在该网络上是无需授权的，因此您可以立即开始使用。

我们认为您不应该局限于仅与一个区块链上的应用程序进行交互。这会导致糟糕的用户体验，强制您重新连接到新的网络并在不同的区块链之间转移货币。相反，您应该能够无缝地使用应用程序，而不管它们是在哪里构建的。

这就是为什么在Evmos上，我们使开发者能够创建“跨链”应用程序。这些应用程序只需构建一次，即可从多个链上访问。因此，您可以无缝地与Evmos上的应用程序进行交互，而无需知道它们所基于的底层区块链。

## 什么是dApps？

Evmos托管了一个丰富的去中心化应用程序（dApps）生态系统，这些应用程序正在颠覆传统的金融、创意所有权、游戏、治理等概念。dApp被称为“去中心化”，因为它不依赖于集中实体，而是将所有权归还给社区。

dApp的核心业务逻辑是通过智能合约实现的。这些合约在一个公开可见的去中心化网络（Evmos）上执行代码。而中心化应用程序（例如Airbnb）则在私下受监管的环境中执行代码，例如应用程序自己的服务器。

## 在Evmos上可以做什么？

一旦连接到Evmos网络，您可以在无需银行或支付服务的情况下进行点对点的资金转账，或与跨链dApps进行交互。

除了由开发者社区构建的应用程序之外，Evmos核心开发团队还构建了自己的dApps。以下是一些示例：

* [资产](https://app.evmos.org/assets) - 查看、提取和存入跨链代币，就像银行账户一样
* [质押](https://app.evmos.org/staking) - 通过质押您的代币并获得每日利息，帮助保持网络的稳定性
* [治理](https://app.evmos.org/governance) - Evmos以托管区块链领域中最活跃的治理之一而闻名

要开始使用，请阅读以下部分，了解如何连接您的钱包、转移代币并与 dApp 进行交互。如果您想在 Evmos 上开始构建跨链应用程序，请转到开发部分。

# Getting Started

## What is Evmos?

Evmos is the blockchain network, that lets you use a new generation of applications, built by developers across the world. Using and building on the network is permissionless so it doesn't require any authorization and you can get started right now.

We believe that you shouldn't be constrained to interacting with applications on only one blockchain. This creates a bad user experience forcing you to reconnect to new networks and transfer currencies between different blockchains. Instead, you should be able to seamlessly use applications, regardless of where they are built.

That's why at Evmos we enable developers to create applications "cross-chain". These are built once and are accessible from across multiple chains. As a result, you can seamlessly interact with applications on Evmos, without having to know what underlying blockchain they are built on.

## What are dApps?

Evmos hosts a rich ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), that are disrupting traditional ideas from finance, creative ownership, gaming, governance, and more. A dApp is called "decentralized", as it doesn't rely on a centralized entity and instead gives back ownership to the community.

A dApp's core business logic is implemented through smart contracts. These contracts execute code over a decentralized network (Evmos) that is publicly visible. A centralized application (e.g. Airbnb) instead executes code in a privately regulated environment such as the application’s own servers.

## What can you do on Evmos?

Once connected to the Evmos network, you can send money peer-to-peer without the need for banks or payment services or interact with cross-chain dApps.

Alongside the applications built by the developer community, the Evmos Core Development Team also builds its own dApps. Here are some examples:

* [Assets](https://app.evmos.org/assets) - View, withdraw, and deposit cross-chain tokens like a bank account
* [Staking](https://app.evmos.org/staking) - Help keep the network stable, by staking your tokens and earning a daily interest on your stake.
* [Governance](https://app.evmos.org/governance) - Evmos is known for hosting one of the most active governance in the blockchain space.

To get started, read about how to connect your wallet, transfer tokens and interact with dApps in the following sections. If you want to start building cross-chain applications on Evmos, head over to the development section.
